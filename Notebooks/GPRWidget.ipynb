    "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an electromagnetic survey method typically used for very near surface geophysical applications (metres to 10s of metres). During GPR surveys, a source antenna (Tx) is used to send a pulse of high-frequency electromagnetic waves (radiowaves) into the ground. As the radiowaves propagate through the Earth, they are distorted as a result of the Earthâ€™s electromagnetic properties. At physical property interfaces, the radiowave signals may undergo transmission, reflection and/or refraction. Radiowave signals measured by a receiver antenna (Rx) are plotted on a radargram and used for interpretation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Widget is to demonstrate how parameters characterizing a physical model can be adjusted to fit field collected GPR data for several cases. By fitting radargram data with a set of model parameters, we can infer the location and dimensions of buried targets of interest (e.g. pipes, sediment layers, cement casings, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPR widget is separated into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Finding a layered Earth model that fits noiseless data from a common shot gather\n",
    "- Step 2: Finding a layered Earth model that fits field collected common midpoint data\n",
    "- Step 3: Finding parameters that fit the signatures from (a) buried pipes and (b) a concrete slab in common offset data."

## Overview

This is a repo of interactive examples for http://gpg.geosci.xyz.

The notebooks are available on
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb)

## Launching the notebooks

The notebooks can be run in different ways:
- online in the [UBC Open JupyterHub](#UBC-Open-JupyterHub),
- online through [Binder](#Binder), or
- [download and run them locally](#Locally).

### UBC Open JupyterHub 

These instructions are for running the notebooks on the UBC open JupyterHub: https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca

1. Login to the JupyterHub using your CWL

2. Under "Other" open a terminal 

![open-jupyterhub-terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6361812/186590219-7c8a5cab-adbb-42cb-b848-2f0ede3f5698.png)

3. Copy-paste the following line and hit enter to clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/geoscixyz/gpgLabs.git
```

4. From the same terminal, run the following line of code to enter the gpgLabs directory 
```
cd gpgLabs
```

5. Run the following line to setup the environment we need for running the notebooks 
```
sh setup.sh
```

6. Now you should be able to run the notebooks! You can close the terminal and navigate to the index notebook

7. For all notebooks, you will need to set the kernel to `e350`

### Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipyn)

1. Launch the binder by clicking on the badge above or going to: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb.
   This can sometimes take a couple minutes, so be patient...

2. Select the notebook of interest from the contents

3. [Run the Jupyter notebook](#Running-the-notebooks)

![Binder-steps](https://em.geosci.xyz/_images/binder-steps.png)

### Locally

To run them locally, you will need to have Python installed, preferably through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

You can then clone this repository. From a command line, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/geoscixyz/gpgLabs.git
```

Then `cd` into `gpgLabs`:

```
cd gpgLabs
```

To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geosci-labs
```

Alternatively, you can install dependencies through PyPI
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch Jupyter
```
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.

## How to run the cells

Each cell of code can be run with `Shift+Enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `Cell` and `Run All` in the toolbar.

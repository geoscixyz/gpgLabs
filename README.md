## Launching the notebooks

The notebooks can be run online through [Binder](#Binder), or [downloaded and run locally](#Locally).

### Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipyn)

1. Launch the binder by clicking on the badge above or going to: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/geoscixyz/gpgLabs/main?filepath=notebooks%2Findex.ipynb.
   This can sometimes take a couple minutes, so be patient...

2. Select the notebook of interest from the contents

3. [Run the Jupyter notebook](#Running-the-notebooks)

### Locally

To run them locally, you will need to have python installed, preferably through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

You can then clone this reposiroty. From a command line, run

```
git clone https://github.com/geoscixyz/gpgLabs.git
```

Then `cd` into `gpgLabs`

```
cd gpgLabs
```

To setup your software environment, we recommend you use the provided conda environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geosci-labs
```

alternatively, you can install dependencies through pypi
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch Jupyter
```
jupyter notebook
```

Jupyter will then launch in your web-browser.

## Running the notebooks

Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `cell`, `Run All` in the toolbar.
